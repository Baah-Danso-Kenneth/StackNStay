# StacksStay Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Wallet Connection Problems

**Issue: "Connect Wallet" button doesn't work**
Solutions:
1. Ensure Hiro Wallet browser extension is installed and updated
2. Refresh the page (Cmd+R on Mac, Ctrl+R on Windows)
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet from extension
4. Disable other wallet extensions (MetaMask, Phantom) - they can conflict
5. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
6. Clear browser cache: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data

**Issue: Wallet connects but shows zero balance**
Solutions:
1. Check if you're on the correct network (Mainnet vs Testnet)
2. Verify you sent STX to the correct address
3. Wait for transaction confirmation (check Stacks Explorer)
4. Switch networks in Hiro Wallet and switch back
5. Try importing your wallet in a fresh Hiro Wallet installation

**Issue: "Wallet locked" message**
Solution:
Enter your wallet password in the Hiro Wallet extension. The wallet auto-locks after inactivity for security.

### Transaction Issues

**Issue: Transaction stuck on "Pending" for over 1 hour**
Solutions:
1. Check transaction status on Stacks Explorer with your TX ID
2. If truly stuck, it will eventually timeout and return to your wallet
3. During high network activity, transactions can take 30-60 minutes
4. For urgent bookings, increase transaction fee in wallet settings
5. Contact support with TX ID if stuck over 2 hours

**Issue: "Insufficient funds" error but I have enough STX**
Causes and solutions:
1. You need booking cost + transaction fee (~0.1 STX additional)
2. If you have pending transactions, that STX is temporarily locked
3. Your wallet might show total balance, not available balance
4. Solution: Add 0.2-0.5 more STX to your wallet for buffer

**Issue: Transaction failed with error code**
Common error codes:
- Error u100: Not authorized (you're not the property owner or booking participant)
- Error u103: Invalid amount (check if amount is correct in micro-STX)
- Error u104: Property not available (host may have delisted)
- Error u105: Booking not found (check booking ID)
Solution: Read the error code, fix the issue, and retry

**Issue: "Transaction rejected" after wallet approval**
Causes
