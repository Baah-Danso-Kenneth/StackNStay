# StacksStay Platform Guide

## What is StacksStay?
StacksStay is a decentralized vacation rental marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain. Unlike traditional platforms like Airbnb, StacksStay uses smart contracts to handle bookings and payments, ensuring transparency and security without intermediaries.

## How Does Booking Work?

### Step 1: Browse Properties
Search for properties by location, price, number of bedrooms, or other filters. All properties are listed by individual hosts on the blockchain.

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
You need a Stacks-compatible wallet (like Hiro Wallet) to book properties. Your wallet is your identity on StacksStay - no email, password, or personal information required.

### Step 3: Book and Pay
When you book a property:
1. Select your check-in and check-out dates
2. The total cost is calculated (nightly rate × nights + 2% platform fee)
3. Connect your wallet and approve the transaction
4. Your STX is transferred to the smart contract escrow

### Step 4: Escrow Protection
Your payment is held securely in a smart contract (escrow) until check-in time. Neither the host nor StacksStay can access these funds before check-in. This protects you if the host cancels.

### Step 5: Automatic Payment Release
At check-in time (based on blockchain block height), the smart contract automatically releases payment to the host. The 2% platform fee goes to StacksStay.

## What is STX?
STX (Stacks) is the cryptocurrency used on StacksStay. It's the native token of the Stacks blockchain, which is secured by Bitcoin. You can buy STX on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.

1 STX = 1,000,000 micro-STX (the unit used in smart contracts)

## Smart Contract Escrow

### What is Escrow?
Escrow means a trusted third party holds money until both parties fulfill their obligations. On StacksStay, the "third party" is code (a smart contract), not a company.

### How Escrow Protects You (Guest):
- Host can't access your money until check-in
- If host cancels, you get an automatic refund
- No one can change the rules once booking is made

### How Escrow Protects Hosts:
- Guest can't claim refund after check-in without proof
- Payment is guaranteed once guest books
- No chargebacks (unlike credit cards)

## Cancellation Policy

### Guest Cancels:
- More than 7 days before check-in: 100% refund
- 3-7 days before check-in: 50% refund
- Less than 3 days before check-in: No refund
- After check-in: No refund

### Host Cancels:
- Guest receives full refund automatically
- Host's reputation is negatively impacted

## Reviews and Reputation

### Leaving Reviews:
- Only guests and hosts from completed bookings can leave reviews
- Reviews are stored permanently on the blockchain
- You can rate 1-5 stars and write a comment
- Both parties can review each other

### Reputation Score:
- Your average rating is calculated from all reviews
- Displayed as stars (e.g., 4.8 ⭐)
- Helps build trust in the community

## Disputes

### When to Raise a Dispute:
- Property doesn't match listing
- Safety or cleanliness issues
- Host or guest doesn't fulfill obligations

### How Disputes Work:
1. Either party can raise a dispute during or after the stay
2. Provide detailed description and evidence
3. Platform admin reviews the case
4. Admin decides on fair refund percentage (0-100%)
5. Smart contract executes the refund

## Wallet Setup

### Getting Started with Hiro Wallet:
1. Install Hiro Wallet browser extension
2. Create new wallet (save your Secret Key safely!)
3. Fund wallet with STX from an exchange
4. Connect to StacksStay

### Security Tips:
- NEVER share your Secret Key with anyone
- Write down your Secret Key and store it safely offline
- StacksStay will NEVER ask for your Secret Key
- Always verify you're on the correct website before connecting wallet

## Fees

### Platform Fee:
StacksStay charges 2% on all bookings. This is calculated as:
- Base cost = nightly rate × number of nights
- Platform fee = base cost × 0.02
- Total = base cost + platform fee

Example: 5 nights at 1,000 STX/night
- Base: 5,000 STX
- Fee: 100 STX (2%)
- Total: 5,100 STX

### Why So Low?
Traditional platforms like Airbnb charge 15-20% in fees. StacksStay's smart contracts automate everything, eliminating expensive middlemen.

## Block Heights vs. Dates

### What is Block Height?
The Stacks blockchain produces blocks approximately every 10 minutes. Block height is the number of blocks since the blockchain started.

### Why Use Block Heights?
Smart contracts use block heights instead of calendar dates because they're more reliable on the blockchain. The frontend converts your selected dates to approximate block heights.

### Example:
- You select March 10, 2024 for check-in
- Frontend calculates: ~block 830,000
- Smart contract uses block 830,000 for check-in

## Privacy and Decentralization

### What Data is Stored:
- On blockchain: Property IDs, prices, booking dates, amounts, reviews
- Off blockchain: Property photos (IPFS), descriptions, amenities

### What's NOT Stored:
- Your name, email, or phone number
- Payment card information
- Personal identification documents

### True Ownership:
- Hosts own their property listings
- Users own their booking records
- No company can freeze your account or censor your listings

## Getting Help

### Common Issues:

**"My transaction is pending forever"**
Check the Stacks blockchain explorer with your transaction ID. Transactions usually confirm within 10-30 minutes.

**"I don't have enough STX"**
You need enough STX to cover the booking cost plus a small transaction fee (~0.1 STX). Buy more STX on an exchange.

**"Host isn't responding"**
Hosts have 24 hours to respond. If no response, you can cancel for a full refund (if more than 7 days before check-in).

**"Property doesn't match listing"**
Take photos and raise a dispute immediately. Admin will review and determine fair refund.
